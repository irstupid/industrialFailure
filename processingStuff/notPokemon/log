Ok so I think I should start documenting stuff so I'm making this little log book so I remember what I do.

Log 1:
It usually starts at day 0 but I dident have a log that day and its all going to get replaced by my new idea. So basically I want to have a Map class that can take in a class, like tote really cool objectified ones where your like Map<T> { } and then Map<PImage> wowSoCool = new Map<PImage>(); this would solve al my previous issues with the map system because I can just have multiple layers its perfect. I also want a library so it just has to load once and that sounds super efficient, and collision detection is gonna be crazy fast because we can just get literally 4 things from an array. I still don't know exactly how collisions are gonna work but we will cross that bridge when we get there. Bye :)

Log 2:
I mostly worked on frc today but i learned how hasmaps work and they are literaly just inbuilt tile maps so thats really cool and usefule. now i have to learn how jsons work thats gonna be fun. Bye

Log 3:
oh my god i did so much stuff. ok so first of all im coding at my dads house for like, the first time, and thats super fun. the keybord is wonderuffl and clicky and nice (thanks papa ^u^). i got the whole map thing working and its SO COOL! it loads from a json, but not the library, wich i initaly thoughwas sad and a flaw, but relized its actually a seceret blessing because with the power of hashmaps you can use 1 tilemap and just have differnet librarys that state "this is this image" and "this is a wall" and its so cool. then i made a cool little looping thing to draw all the tiles and it keeps track of the tallest tile and uses transformation shenanigans to automatically alighn any grid of arbitrarily sized tiles. its fucking awsome. i also ave plans on how the gameplay will do be. so squishmellows, like the ones me and della got for our birthdays (btw happy birthday della), fight. it wold be like pokemon but only 4 types: fire, water, earth, air. fire beats air, air beats earth, earth beats water, water beats fire. they would only have 3 moves buttttttt they could move durring battle tabeltop style. like tabletop pokemon, but videogame. also caleb and i are actually making a table top version w/ the squishmellows we have and we have some of the numbers down and things. but thast a long way off from being impelmented. right now the next thing would be camera movement, but i dont really want to make a whole map out of a json so i might make a map editing tool that be cool im not a fool; pool; bool.
