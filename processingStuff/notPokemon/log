Ok so I think I should start documenting stuff so I'm making this little log book so I remember what I do.

Log 1:
It usually starts at day 0 but I dident have a log that day and its all going to get replaced by my new idea. 
So basically I want to have a Map class that can take in a class, like tote really cool objectified ones where your like Map<T> { } and then Map<PImage> wowSoCool = new Map<PImage>(); 
this would solve al my previous issues with the map system because I can just have multiple layers its perfect. I also want a library so it just has to load once and that sounds super efficient, 
and collision detection is gonna be crazy fast because we can just get literally 4 things from an array. I still don't know exactly how collisions are gonna work but we will cross that bridge when we get there. Bye :)

Log 2:
I mostly worked on frc today but i learned how hasmaps work and they are literaly just inbuilt tile maps so thats really cool and usefule. now i have to learn how jsons work thats gonna be fun. Bye
